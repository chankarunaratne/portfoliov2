## General Principles

- **Do not break existing functionality**  
  New features or code changes must never break current behavior of the portfolio. Implement the new changes in a way that it won't break or change the other elements.

- **Scalable code**  
  Any new component or UI element must be written with future extensibility in mind (e.g., easy theming, flexible layout, maintainable CSS).

- **No hallucinations**  
  Never invent components, icons, sections, or layouts. Always stick exactly to the user-provided instructions.
